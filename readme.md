## Local development

IRP source requires [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Run `npm install` to download the required packages, `grunt` to perform a one of processing of code (does not run a server), and `grunt serve` to watch for code changes, and run a local server.
